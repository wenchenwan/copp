//! General shared definitions and numeric utilities for TOPP/COPP flows.
//!
//! # Method identity
//! This module hosts lightweight, cross-cutting primitives that are reused by
//! multiple solver/formulation layers, including:
//! - interpolation policy descriptors for output trajectory sampling;
//! - tolerant floating-point comparison helpers used by feasibility and
//!   convergence checks.
//!
//! # Design notes
//! - Types here are intentionally small and dependency-free.
//! - Approximate comparison uses a mixed tolerance
//!   $\max(\text{abs\_tol},\ \text{rel\_tol}\cdot\max(|x_1|,|x_2|))$.
//! - `approx_order()` is preferred over direct equality checks when decisions
//!   depend on floating-point values near boundaries.
