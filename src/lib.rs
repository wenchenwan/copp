//! `copp` crate public API.
//!
//! # What problem does this library solve?
//! This library targets **OPP** (Optimal Path Parameterization) problems.
//! Given a geometric path parameterization
//! $q = q(s)$, the solver finds a time law $s = s(t)$ such that constraints are
//! satisfied while an objective is optimized.
//!
//! In short, we convert geometry-space motion into time-space scheduling:
//! $$
//! q = q(s) \quad \Longrightarrow \quad s = s(t),
//! $$
//! and solve for globally optimal / KKT-satisfying / heuristic near-optimal
//! trajectories under the selected backend and objective model.
//!
//! # Objective families: TOPP vs COPP
//! - **TOPP**: Time-Optimal Path Parameterization (typical objective is minimum
//!   traversal time).
//! - **COPP**: Convex-Objective Path Parameterization (supports richer convex
//!   objectives beyond pure time-optimality).
//!
//! For non-convex objectives, a practical approach is **SCP**:
//! perform DC decomposition and iterative objective linearization. Constraint
//! linearization (notably for third-order models) is already implemented in this
//! crate. For objective modeling details, see COPP solver families and
//! [`CoppObjective`](crate::prelude::CoppObjective)-related APIs.
//!
//! # Constraint-order families: 2nd vs 3rd order
//! - **2nd-order** (TOPP2/COPP2): commonly covers velocity, acceleration,
//!   and torque-related constraints.
//! - **3rd-order** (TOPP3/COPP3): additionally models jerk-level effects.
//!
//! User-defined constraints are supported at different abstraction levels:
//! - prefer [`robot::Robot`] for physically meaningful high-level ingestion;
//! - use [`constraints::Constraints`] directly for maximum low-level flexibility.
//!
//! # Supported problem classes
//! This crate provides solvers for four major classes:
//! - `TOPP2`
//! - `COPP2`
//! - `TOPP3`
//! - `COPP3`
//!
//! # Recommended onboarding path
//! 1. Build constraints with [`robot::Robot`] (or directly with
//!    [`constraints::Constraints`] for advanced customization).
//! 2. Choose a solver family from [`solver`] based on objective/accuracy/runtime.
//! 3. Start quickly with [`prelude`] for common imports.
