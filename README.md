This library targets **Optimal Path Parameterization (OPP)** for robotic trajectory generation. Typical application domains include robotic motion planning and CNC machining.


Given an $n$-dimensional geometric path parameterization

$$
\boldsymbol{q} = \boldsymbol{q}(s),\text{ }s\in[0,s_\text{f}],\text{ (}s_\text{f}\text{ is known)}
$$

the objective is to schedule a dynamically feasible time parameterization

$$
s = s(t),\text{ }t\in[0,t_\text{f}],\text{ (}t_\text{f}\text{ is unknown)}
$$

so that the specified system constraints  are satisfied while an objective $J$ is optimized. In this way, the problem is transformed from geometry-space description to time-space scheduling along a fixed path.

At a high level, this project unifies two system orders and two objective families:

- **2nd-order models**: constraints on velocity, acceleration, torque, etc. The constraint can be written as $\boldsymbol{f}(\boldsymbol{q}(s),\dot{\boldsymbol{q}}(s),\ddot{\boldsymbol{q}}(s);s)\leq\boldsymbol{0}$, and the objective is $\min J=\int_0^{t_\text{f}}L(\boldsymbol{q}(s),\dot{\boldsymbol{q}}(s),\ddot{\boldsymbol{q}}(s);s)\mathrm{d}t$.
- **3rd-order models**: additionally include jerk-related effects. The constraint can be written as $\boldsymbol{f}(\boldsymbol{q}(s),\dot{\boldsymbol{q}}(s),\ddot{\boldsymbol{q}}(s),\dddot{\boldsymbol{q}}(s);s)\leq\boldsymbol{0}$, and the objective is $\min J=\int_0^{t_\text{f}}L(\boldsymbol{q}(s),\dot{\boldsymbol{q}}(s),\ddot{\boldsymbol{q}}(s),\dddot{\boldsymbol{q}}(s);s)\mathrm{d}t$.
- **TOPP** (Time-Optimal Path Parameterization): minimizes traversal time, i.e., $L\equiv1$ and the objective is $J=t_\text{f}$.
- **COPP** (Convex-Objective Path Parameterization): supports broader convex objectives. The objective $L$ should be convex with respect to the state and control: $(\dot{s}^2,\ddot{s})$ in 2nd-order models and $(\dot{s}^2,\ddot{s},\frac{\dddot{s}}{\dot{s}})$ in 3rd-order models.

The resulting taxonomy is summarized below.

| Smoothness order                                     | Time-optimal objective | General convex objective |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 2nd-order (velocity/acceleration/torque constraints) | TOPP2                  | COPP2                    |
| 3rd-order (+ jerk constraints)                       | TOPP3                  | COPP3                    |

## Why use COPP instead of re-implementing from scratch?

Unless you are a specialist researcher in TOPP/COPP, we strongly recommend using this library directly. In practical deployment, many critical implementation details are easy to overlook, for example:

+ strict constraint satisfaction rather than soft-constraint relaxation;
+ guaranteed geometric consistency: the executed trajectory $\boldsymbol{q}=\boldsymbol{q}(s(t))$ remains exactly on the original geometric path $\boldsymbol{q}=\boldsymbol{q}(s)$, avoiding additional contour error introduced by the COPP stage;
+ prevention of reverse motion and zero-velocity singularities (i.e., enforcing $\dot{s}>0$ strictly almost everywhere);
+ [certifiable feasibility guarantees, especially for long-path online planning](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmachtools.2025.104355), a challenge only recently addressed in the literature;
+ [boundary acceleration continuity handling](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmachtools.2025.104355), which is frequently problematic in existing methods. Some algorithms bypass this issue by ignoring boundary-acceleration constraints or by disallowing stationary boundary conditions $\dot{s}=0,\ddot{s}=0$, instead requiring $\dot{s}>\delta$.

## Quick Start

### General workflow

+ **Inputs**
    + path grid: prepare a strictly increasing station grid $0=s_0<s_1<\dots<s_{n-1}=s_\text{f}$;
    + path data: provide path derivatives through `Path` evaluators or sampled matrices. 2nd-order problems use $\boldsymbol{q}$, $\frac{\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{q}}{\mathrm{d}s}$, and $\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\boldsymbol{q}}{\mathrm{d}s^2}$; 3rd-order problems additionally use $\frac{\mathrm{d}^3\boldsymbol{q}}{\mathrm{d}s^3}$;
    + robot and constraints: create a `Robot`, attach the station grid with `with_s`, then fill path data with `with_q_from_path_2nd` or `with_q_from_path_3rd`. Standard constraint APIs include `with_axial_velocity`, `with_axial_acceleration`, `with_axial_torque`, and `with_axial_jerk` for 3rd-order problems. Asymmetric and station-dependent limits are supported;
    + objective: TOPP solvers use traversal time as the objective. COPP solvers take a list of built-in `CoppObjective` terms, such as `CoppObjective::Time`, `CoppObjective::ThermalEnergy`, `CoppObjective::TotalVariationTorque`, and `CoppObjective::Linear`.
+ **Problem construction**
    + 2nd-order: build a `Topp2Problem` or `Copp2Problem` with `Topp2ProblemBuilder` or `Copp2ProblemBuilder`;
    + 3rd-order: first prepare a feasible linearization profile `a_linearization`, commonly from `topp2_ra`. Optionally use `robot.constraints.amax_substitute(...)` to tighten the first-order upper bound. Then build the problem with `Topp3ProblemBuilder::build_with_linearization` or `Copp3ProblemBuilder::build_with_linearization`.
+ **Solving**
    + choose the solver namespace according to the problem class and algorithm, for example `solver::topp2_ra`, `solver::copp2_socp`, `solver::topp3_lp`, `solver::topp3_socp`, or `solver::copp3_socp`;
    + build solver options with the corresponding options builder, then call the solver function.
+ **Outputs and post-processing**
    + 2nd-order solvers return an `a` profile, where $a(s)=\dot{s}^2$;
    + 3rd-order solvers return a `Topp3Profile`, containing `a`, `b`, and stationary-boundary metadata;
    + convert path-domain profiles to timing data with `s_to_t_topp2` or `s_to_t_topp3`. For a `Topp3Profile`, pass `profile.as_parts()`;
    + convert timing data to sampled inverse parameterization `s(t)` with `t_to_s_topp2` or `t_to_s_topp3`;
    + evaluate the original path at `s(t)` to generate position, velocity, and acceleration references for downstream controllers.

COPP3-RDDP can also be used as a TOPP3 solver, with significantly better time-optimality than TOPP3-RA and TOPP3-LP in many cases. For very long paths, COPP3-RDDP may even exhibit better practical optimality and numerical stability than COPP3-SOCP, since large-scale conic optimization can become limited by convergence behavior and computational-resource constraints. |
